# `mops`

`mops` is a Python library for ML Operations.

Jump to link:docs/quickstart.adoc[Quickstart] if +++<del>+++you're impatient+++</del>+++ prefer examples, like me!

`mops` solves for four core design goals:

* link:docs/optimizations.adoc[Efficient] transfer of link:docs/pure_functions.adoc[pure] function execution to link:docs/remote.adoc[remote] execution environments with more &|
  different compute resources
* Everything in written in standard Python with basic Python primitives; no frameworks, YAML, DSLs...
* link:docs/memoization.adoc[Memoization] — i.e. _reproducibility and fault tolerance_ — for individual functions.
* Droppability: `mops` shouldn't entangle itself with your code, and you should always be able to run your code with or without `mops` in the loop.

It is used by link:docs/basic_usage.adoc[decorating or wrapping your pure function and then calling it] like a normal function.


## Requirements

* Python >= 3.8
* itself to be installed in the link:docs/remote.adoc[remote] execution context as well as in the
  link:docs/orchestrator.adoc[local] environment.
* link:docs/pure_functions.adoc['pure' functions]
* your function and its arguments to be link:docs/serialization.adoc[serializable] with `pickle`.
* (if using remote compute) ADLS read+write access on the link:docs/orchestrator.adoc[local/orchestrator] and the link:docs/remote.adoc[remote] runtime.

It is usually used with remote compute on:

* link:docs/kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes], with code distributed as a Docker image

---or---

* link:../../libs/dbxtend/README.md[dbxtend] (currently internal-only), with code distributed to Databricks as Python wheels.

It optionally integrates with:

* https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest[`joblib`] for local parallelism.

## Limitations

It has some link:docs/limitations.adoc[limitations].

## Tools & Debugging

* link:docs/tools.adoc[Here are some tools for debugging] your functions that are running under `mops`.

## Development

If making changes to the library, please bump the version in `pyproject.toml` accordingly.

Also look at our link:CHANGES.md[changelog].

### Running tests

* `poetry run pytest tests`

To run integration tests against a remote blob store, you'll need to set up some configuration. TODO explain config.

* `poetry run pytest tests -m integration`
