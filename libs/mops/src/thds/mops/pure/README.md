# thds.mops.pure

A facility for transparently running _pure_ Python functions in such a way that their execution
environment can be independent of the caller, and so that their results can be memoizable.

The core `MemoizingPicklingRunner` implementation uses:

- `pickle` for serialization
- `ADLS` for remote storage

though each of these implementation details is independent of the others, and other implementations of
the same system could be written.

The standard remote runtime shim implementation is Kubernetes, but integration tests run using a simple
subprocess shim, and running on Azure Functions or local Docker containers would be easy to implement.
