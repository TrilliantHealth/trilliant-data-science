"""Bidirectional, context-sensitive translation: Source <--> (Hashref | URI).

Hashrefs - passing data blobs of many kinds into remote functions by their Hash where
possible, then using a separate lookup file per hash to tell us where the actual data is
stored.

- local file source containing a Hash - can be optimized with hashref
- remote file source containing a Hash - can be optimized with hashref
- remote file source only having URI - cannot be optimized - passed as a raw URI.

Decoupling hashref creation from potential upload is important because it lets us avoid
upload in cases where the Shim turns out to be a local machine shim.

We create hashrefs for Sources on the local machine in a shared location. Since this
data is immutable and content-addressed, there should be no serious concurrency objections
to this approach.

Then, if we cross a boundary into a Shim that will start execution on a different
machine, we serialize the local Path to content-addressed storage in the current active
storage root, and we then create a hashref in the active storage root (again, these
should be effectively immutable on the shared store even if they will mostly likely get
rewritten multiple times).

On the remote side, we will first check the local hashref location. It may very well not
exist at all.  If it does, we should attempt to follow it, but the referent may not
exist (for whatever reason) and in all cases we are able to fall back to looking for a
remote hashref and following its reference.

We are keeping the core business logic completely separate from pickling.  All
serialization methods will have to choose how to represent the information returned by
this module, but it should be able to call back into this module with that same state to
have a Source object returned to it while it performs low-level deserialization.

#
# when returning a Source from a remote, we cannot avoid the upload.  this is because the
# uploaded data is part of the memoized result, and memoization by definition is available
# to all callers, even those on other machines/environments.
#
# A good example of where this is necessary is memoizing Person API test data in CI.  the
# code runs locally, but the goal is to create an output file that can be reused next time
# it runs (locally or in CI). And for that to be possible, the output _must_ be uploaded.
#
# This does not mean that the Source itself must be uploaded immediately upon creation;
# just that mops must detect Sources in the return value and must force an upload on them.
# In essence, this creates a bifurcated code path for Sources during serialization; if
# we're "on the way out", we avoid uploading until it is clear that the data will be used
# in a remote environment. Whereas "on the way back", we must always upload, and nothing
# can or should be deferred; upload should happen at the time of serialization.
#
# Nevertheless, a local caller should still be able to short-circuit the _download_ by
# using a locally-created File, if on the same machine where the local file was created.
