        Transmitted Path resources will be content-hash-addressed
        below the runner_prefix to save storage and increase chances
        of memoization. Named objects will be treated
        similarly. Function invocations will be pickled and stored
        under the current pipeline id since we do not have a way of
        inferring whether their associated code is safely content-addressable
        across runs.

        The Shim must forward control in the remote environment to a
        wrapper that will pull the function and arguments from the URI(s).

        A ShimBuilder will receive the original function and its
        original arguments, which you can use to determine which
        concrete Shim implementation to return for the given function
        call.

        `rerun_exceptions` will cause a pre-existing `exception`
        result to be ignored, as though Exceptions in your function
        are the result of transient errors and not an expected return
        value of a (simulated) pure function. If you do not want this
        behavior, turn it off.

        `redirect` changes only the function that is actually invoked
        on the remote side of the runner. It does not change the
        computed memoization key, which is still based on the original
        function and the args, kwargs pair passed in. A common use for
        this would be allowing a contextually-aware function to be
        invoked in the manner of initializer/initargs, without those
        additional bits being part of the function invocation and
        therefore the memoization key, especially where they're not
        picklable at all.
