= Memoization/caching

A link:./pure_functions.adoc[pure function] is a fully-specified computation with a
deterministic result based on its arguments. If the function and its arguments remain the same, then a
future call to that function, even from a different process on a different computer, should be able to
return the previously-computed result rather than re-computing.

[sidebar]
One scenario where this might be useful would be in the case of some kind of
failure of your long-running orchestrator process. Another scenario would be the
architectural approach of sharing results that you know someone else has already computed.

NOTE: If you _aren't_ using the `pure.magic` API, a unique pipeline id is generated for
every application run, so no results will be memoized across processes. See
link:pipeline-ids.adoc[pipeline ids] for how to change this.

== Conceptual system in `mops`:

At the time of function call, each function wrapped with `mops` `MemoizingPicklingRunner`
(or link:magic.adoc[`@pure.magic`]) will combine:

* the current blob root
* a `mops`-specific prefix, `mops2-mpf`, which exists to keep the root namespace organized
* the link:pipeline-ids.adoc[current `pipeline_id`]
* the fully-qualfied name (including module) of the function
* the `function-logic-key` on the docstring (if any)
* and the hash of the serialized arguments (input) to the function

to produce a _deterministic_ remote storage location for the invocation and also for the
eventual results.

****
Why so many bits and pieces?

When you think about a function in the common sense, it's easy to forget that,
mathematically, a function isn't just a named bit of code - it's a *unique and immutable
transform*, of the input domain into the output codomain.

But in code, we change the code for functions (or the other functions they call) all the
time. We don't ordinarily rename the function afterward, but the actual effect of the
function has changed - technically it's a totally new function!

`mops` provides several different approaches to making it easier to map the mathematical
universe onto the everyday one that programmers inhabit. Perhaps _too many_ approaches -
they certainly overlap a bit at points. But collectively they provide a set of tools to
making your functions and their results a bit easier to wrangle, organize, and reason
about.
****

In its entirety, the unique invocation of your function with its arguments hash
constitutes the `memo_uri` - a `mops`-controlled namespace for the specific function under
the specific circumstances of its single invocation.

_Before_ invoking the function remotely, the `MemoizingPicklingRunner` will check to see if a result
already exists at the expected path, and if it does, that result will be returned _instead_ of running
the remote computation.

This allows function results to be reused across time regardless of who calls the function or when they
call it.

[WARNING]
====
Whether or not memoized results are available at the fully-derived `memo_uri`
will _not_ prevent _new, unmemoized_ results from being computed and inserted into the
blob store.

In other words, no error will be raised if the result is not already present. This is a
**non-destructive** re-use of the namespace, because no existing results will be modified in any way -
but an existing blob store is never immune to **modification** if provided to `mops`.
====

In cases where all you want is memoization (you don't care about transferring execution to
a truly link:./remote.adoc[remote execution environment]), you can use `@pure.magic()`
with no further customization.

In order to share results across machines, you'll want to configure at minimum the blob
root to point to a shared blob store.

The other bits and pieces and their purposes are documented below.

== Configurability

At the time of function call, a fully-qualified `memo_uri` is derived from the following
components which are either chosen explicitly by the user, determined by names in code ,
or which arise from `@pure.magic` defaults`.

1. A blob root (non-optional, user-controlled, has `pure.magic` default).
   `pure.magic` sets the default blob root as `$HOME/.mops-root`.
+
1. [[pipeline-id]] The `pipeline_id` (non-optional, user-controlled, defaults provided
either by `pure.magic` or by local system state)
+
More documentation about pipeline ids may be be link:pipeline-ids.adoc[found here], but
you you should conceptualize the pipeline id as representing a grouping mechanism.  within
your application.
+
1. A `function_id` (defined as a constant by derivation from the function's `+__module__+`
+ `+__name__+` - not user-controllable).
+
This exists to keep identical `(*args, **kwargs)` separate from each other if passed to different
functions. There is no API for this; it's derived automatically.
+
WARNING: If you rename your function, all previous memoized results will no longer be
'found' for that function.

1. A `function-logic-key` (optional, user-controlled, defaults to empty string)
+
The function logic key, if any, will be automatically extracted when present from the
   docstring of the top-level function or any function passed as an argument (however
   nested) to the top-level function.
+
The intent of the `function-logic-key` is to allow you to annotate your function's logic as having
changed (and therefore invalidating previous memoization) without renaming your function (as, in
common software development practice, the name of a function is often a high-level name, not subject
to change every time the function is modified to produce different outputs).
+
[source,python]
----
@pure.use_runner(...)
def barbaz():
   """does some stuff.

   function-logic-key: 241024-v2
   """
   ...
----
+
Function logic keys MUST NOT contain spaces - any whitespace character will be interpreted as the end
of the key.
+
A function may have both a `pipeline-id` and `function-logic-key` annotation in its
docstring. The order does not matter, but each should be on a separate line.
+
1. Hash of function arguments (deterministically defined based on actual arguments passed
to the function - not user-controllable)
+
This can't be affected in any way other than passing different arguments. Don't even
link:advanced_memoization.adoc#keyed-local-runner[think about it].


### Memospace parts

This is an example full `memo_uri` with all its constituent parts labeled. You'll find most of these
names directly link:../src/thds/mops/pure/core/memo/function_memospace.py[in the source code]. For
memoization to retrieve an existing result, the _full_ constructed memo uri must be retrievable from the
provided storage system.

Note that the `invocation-unique-key` is a way of uniquely identifying a function invocation solely by
reference to the user-controllable, storage-agnostic elements of the `memo_uri`.

## Advanced Usage

In general, the blob root and pipeline id should be encoded either in your code (often
preferable and less 'spooky') or in some kind of config that gets loaded into your code at
runtime. So the information above is mostly about 'understanding what they do.'

However, if you want to call a function and get a result that you know already exists (was
run previously and therefore memoized by `MemoizingPicklingRunner`), and you don't wish to
change your current code, you have several options, which are link:advanced_memoization.adoc[documented separately here].
