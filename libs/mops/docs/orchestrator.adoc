# What is an orchestrator?

Simply put, it's a process that tells link:./remote.adoc[other processes] what to do. Often, it then collects
results from those processes and organizes them, or sends those results to other processes for another
round of orchestrated task completion.

A good internal example of an orchestrator is
link:../../../apps/demand-forecast[`demand-forecast`], which orchestrates the
extraction of various slices of Unified Asset data, then orchestrates the training of various models on
that data, and then orchestrates prediction/forecast based on those models.

As an analogy, PySpark code is usually a form of orchestration, though it acts at a somewhat higher level than `mops`,
since your Spark code will often go through a query planner of some sort before the underlying tasks are
generated. `mops` takes a lower-level approach that assumes you already have known tasks that you want to
execute, and that you're willing to write your own code to 'plan' or 'order' their execution.

## Rules for orchestrators

### Concurrency

When running many `mops.pure` functions concurrently, you should prefer to use **threads** rather than
parallel processes. Shared memory within the orchestration parts of the process allows for much simpler
reuse of various contexts, and since the Runner you are using almost certainly builds in process-level
parallelism, there's no additional advantage (and _many_ possible disadvantages) to layering extra
polling processes on top of the underlying processes.

To help with this, we've provided `thds.mops.parallel:parallel_yield_results`, which should be general
enough for many use cases. If it is not, feel free to bring your own concurrency primitives.

#### Joblib backend

A simple `joblib` backend is also provided, for cases where you might already be using it, or if the
library you're using (e.g. `scikit-learn`) is already using it under the hood.

Please note that running thousands of very short (e.g. ten second) tasks is not something K8S excels
at...
