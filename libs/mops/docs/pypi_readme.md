# `mops`

`mops` is a Python library for ML Operations.

`mops` solves for three core issues:

- Transfer of
  [pure](https://github.com/TrilliantHealth/trilliant-data-science/libs/mops/docs/pure_functions.adoc)
  function execution to
  [remote](https://github.com/TrilliantHealth/trilliant-data-science/libs/mops/docs/remote.adoc)
  execution environments with more &| different compute resources
- [Efficient](https://github.com/TrilliantHealth/trilliant-data-science/libs/mops/docs/optimizations.adoc)
  transfer of large blob data to/from other environments.
- [Memoization](https://github.com/TrilliantHealth/trilliant-data-science/libs/mops/docs/memoization.adoc)
  — i.e. _reproducibility and fault tolerance_ — for individual functions.

It is used by
[decorating or wrapping your pure function and then calling it](https://github.com/TrilliantHealth/trilliant-data-science/libs/mops/docs/basic_usage.adoc)
like a normal function.
