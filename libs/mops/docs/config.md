# Configuring `mops`

`mops` ships with a limited set of default config that is generally suitable for data science at
Trilliant Health. This includes basic information about where our [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md) cluster
is (should you need to use that), and some default timeouts.

This configuration file is [TOML](https://toml.io/en/), and if you wish to configure `mops` differently,
there are _several_ [different](../src/thds/mops/config.py) approaches that you can take, depending on
which is most convenient for your use case.

## standalone TOML config

Create a `mops`-only TOML config file, and make sure it includes, at a minimum, values for the keys
defined in the default [`thds.mops.east_config.toml`](../src/thds/mops/east_config.toml).

### MOPS_CONFIG

Take that file, name it whatever you want, and set the environment variable `MOPS_CONFIG` to point to its
fully-qualified path.

### .mops.toml

Or, name that file `.mops.toml` and place that in one of the following locations:

1. The current working directory for the Python process that imports `mops`.
1. Your home directory.

## combined config

Or, define and load the config however you want (e.g. YAML, JSON, XML) within your project, and once you
have a nested Python dictionary that corresponds to the multilevel config table that `mops` expects, call
`thds.mops.config:set_global_config` before beginning to use `mops`.

## dynamic stack-local config

`mops` will also allow your Python application to dynamically override particular config values on a
per-thread/async coroutine level. It provides a context manager for configuration that will allow you to
set the config for all code called 'below' your `with` statement, like so:

```python

with mops.config.set_config("mops", "k8s", "namespace")(your_value):
    call_some_func()
	do_more_stuff()
	# everything in here will see your config value,
	# while anything else running in the same process
	# will see whatever the previously-configured value is.
	...
use_original_config()  # and this will not see the configured value from above
```

# Production runs

The default `mops` configuration file ships with "development-appropriate defaults." To provide the
`MemoizingPicklingRunner` with config that will save your mops memoization files in a production
SA/container, make sure to pass `thds.adls.defaults.env_root` as the second argument to the pickle
runner, and then enable the `prod` environment as per the `thds.core.env` configuration system.
