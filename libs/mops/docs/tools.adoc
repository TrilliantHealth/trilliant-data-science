# Tools & Debugging Applications Using `mops`

NOTE: Remember that all `mops` functions are Python functions. If your function is failing to execute, (where possible) the best first step is to - temporarily - stop wrapping your function with `mops` and run the function locally. You'll avoid any build steps required by the Shim, you can use a debugger, etc.

If you're using `@pure.magic`, you can call `pure.magic.off(your_func)` after the function definition, or use the link:magic.adoc#config-file[config file].

## Tools

### `mops-inspect`

A tool for inspecting the `(args, kwargs)` of a given `mops` function invocation.


If you got an unexpected memoization, or you're wondering why you didn't get memoization, or your code
ran remotely but seems to have produced an unexpected result or error, first find the
memoization/`invocation` URI. Pass the full memo URI to the tool, e.g. `mops-inspect adls://yoursa/cont/mops2-mpf/...`.

** If you want to debug why your function ran a second time, try `--diff-memospace` (see `--help` for more details).

### `mops-summarize`

Summarize an entire application run with multiple `mops` function invocations. See
 the full link:../src/thds/mops/pure/tools/summarize/README.md[README here].
