## Serialization in `mops`

Transferring execution from an link:./orchestrator.adoc[orchestrator] to a link:./remote.adoc[remote] runtime
requires some method of transferring the relevant data to the remote runtime. This is usually called
serialization/deserialization.

### Pickle.... for now.

Because this is a Python-based library, we use Python's built-in `pickle`, which supports a wide range of
Python objects natively, is fairly customizable, and _reasonably_ stable across minor versions of Python
(though not, generally, stable across different implementations of Python, e.g. Pypy vs CPython).

It's not ultimately required that we use pickle, and while we've already written some targeted hooks for
pickle, those should mostly be rewritable for use with other serialization protocols if we decide that we
need something that works differently. In particular, if we later decide that we want to be able to reuse
memoized results from non-Python processes, we would probably want to look into some other form of
serialization.

### multi-layer

[sidebar]
This is purely an implementation detail, and is documented only for those who are curious about what is
going on under the hood...

When we pickle the `(args, kwargs)` to your Python function, or the result from it, our
link:./optimizations.adoc[optimizations] short-circuit the standard pickling process at defined 'hook
points' that are dynamically discovered during pickling. In other words, when we discover (recursively)
some object that we want to handle in a non-standard, optimized way, we do not pickle that object, but
instead a reference to it.

In general, that reference will actually be a separately-serialized blob stored in the same blob store as
the invocation or result to which it belongs.
