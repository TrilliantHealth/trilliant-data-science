= pipeline ids

This is a basic grouping mechanism for `mops` control files and outputs.

== Usage

The pipeline id is chosen for each `mops` wrapped function at the time of call. It can be
set in many ways - probably too many ways. :)

  - it can be set for an entire module or module tree link:magic.adoc#pipeline-id[with `@pure.magic.pipeline_id('baz')`]
  - `@pure.magic` sets a default pipeline id of `magic`.
  - it can be passed to the decorator: `@pure.magic(pipeline_id='baz')`
  - it can be set in the function docstring:
+
[source,python]
----
@pure.use_runner(MemoizingPicklingRunner(...))
def foobar(...):
   """some docs...
   pipeline-id: baz
   """
   ...
----
+
  - it can be 'masked' with `pure.pipeline_id_mask` on a stack-local basis, used as a decorator
    or as a context manager:
+
[source,python]
----
pure.pipeline_id_mask('baz')(foobar)(*args)
----
  - Each of the above will override a usage above it in the list.

== What does it do?

When you run something under `mops`, `mops` puts its own files 'underneath' a root of
`mops2-mpf`.footnote:[`mops` itself is unaware of hierarchy, but your blob store may allow
you to browse blob paths hierarchically, which can be helpful for keeping things clean.]
Within that root will be paths starting with the pipeline ids of any function you have
previously run.footnote:[Pipeline ids can have arbitrary nesting (e.g. `/`) - again,
`mops` doesn't reason about blob stores hierarchically, but if your blob store supports
it, the implicit hierarchy will be useful.]

The paths beyond the pipeline ids are discussed in more depth link:memoization.adoc[here],
but the next piece will be the fully-qualified name of your module-level callable, after
that, any `function-logic-key` added to the docstring, and, finally, an odd-looking string
that is actually a hash of the arguments to your callable.

In addition to the `mops2-mpf` control files, there may also be paths under the root that
begin with the pipeline id directly. Let's say you have 2 functions using `@pure.magic`
with no customizations.  If you look underneath `.mops-root` in the local directory, you
may see only:

[source]
----
.mops-root/mops2-mpf/magic/mod1.mod2--func1/...
----

But if you were to apply a different pipeline id (`for/susan`) to one of the functions, you might then see:

[source]
----
.mops-root/mops2-mpf/magic/mod1.mod2--func1/...
.mops-root/mops2-mpf/for/susan/mod1.mod3--func2/...
----

Furthermore, because `mops` will help you manage large file transfers efficiently, if both
of your functions returned a `core.Source` object, you would also see:

[source]
----
.mops-root/magic/mod1.mod2--func1/february-plants.parquet
.mops-root/for/susan/mod1.mod3--func2/march-plants.parquet
----

There's a lot of similarity in the layout here, but the ``mops``-specific control files
are within `mops2-mpf`, whereas your data is not - but it still uses the pipeline id as a
prefix to help with grouping.

== Purpose

As you can see, the pipeline id functions mainly as a grouping mechanism. Because `mops`
will name certain large output blobs for you,footnote:[It's common to write 'impure'
functions that write files to disk rather than return in-memory objects (which would be
'pure'). But `mops` can't safely memoize your function if there's a chance that an output
will later get overwritten. So `mops` steps in and provides safely unique names for the
types of large blobs it optimizes.] it can be useful to get a top-level grouping in the
blob store just to make things easier to reason about.

NOTE: Another use that can be served by a pipeline id is to allow you to 'start over' for an
entire set of functions. For various reasons, you might find yourself wanting to re-run
everything from scratch without any memoized results.

By setting a different pipeline id (often via `pure.magic.pipeline_id` near the root of your
application), you will 'invalidate the cache' for everything all at once; be deliberate!
You may want to switch to the new run completely, and if you later remove the pipeline id
mask, you'll return to the previous set of results.
