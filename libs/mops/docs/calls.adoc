When memoizing results, there are two things that can change - the code, or the
data. ``mops``'s `MemoizingPicklingRunner` tracks changes to your data without further
effort because your function arguments are serialized and can then be hashed. Tracking
changes to code requires developer input - you set a `function-logic-key` in the function
docstring whenever you make a change - a good pattern for this is an opaque date plus a
descriptive string, e.g. `250420-fooed-the-bar`.

But what if your memoized function calls _another_ memoized function? Should they both
share the same function-logic-key? Do you need to remember to update it in both places
each time? What if your function calls _multiple_ other functions? Some of which might be
called by other functions - must we invalidate everything all at once?

NOTE: Nested memoization is in some ways an antipattern. In the common case where you're running
on cloud infrastructure, you're going to be paying for the outer worker to do nothing but
_wait_ for the inner workers. This is inefficient to a degree proportional to `wait_time *
fraction_of_resources_consumed_by_outer_worker`. In many cases, if you can instead use a
flattened structure, where the link:orchestrator.adoc[orchestrator] launches your inner
job(s), and then calls a follow-up function to process those results, you will have better
efficiency and a cleaner overall flow for your system. However, there may be cases where
the tradeoff makes sense for your use case. Consider asking for design advice if you are
faced with a situation that seems to call for nested memoized functions.

`mops` offers the `calls=[...]` API, which allows you to specify that an outer
function will call an inner function (or functions). The inner function name and
function-logic-key becomes part of the `memo_uri` for your outer function. This way, the
cached results for both the inner and outer functions can be invalidated by a change to
the inner logic key.

When using `pure.magic`, the API looks like this:

[source,python]
----
@pure.magic()
def _internal_quux_func(...):
    """
    function-logic-key: 250420-improvements
    """
    ...


@pure.magic(
    calls=[_internal_quux_func]
)
def foo_the_bar(...) -> Sthing:
    ...
    _internal_quux_func(...)
    ...
----

When using `MemoizingPicklingRunner` directly, you'll need to register the functions on
the same Runner that will be handling your function call:

[source,python]
----
_MPR = MemoizingPicklingRunner(...)

@pure.use_runner(_MPR)
def foo_the_bar(...) -> Sthing:
    _internal_quux_func(...)
    ...

_MPR.calls(foo_the_bar, _internal_quux_func)
----
