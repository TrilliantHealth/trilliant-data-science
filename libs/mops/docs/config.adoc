# Configuring `mops`

We use a https://toml.io/en/[TOML] configuration file format, and if you wish to configure `mops` differently,
there are _several_ link:../src/thds/mops/config.py[different] approaches that you can take, depending on
which is most convenient for your use case.

## standalone TOML config

Create a `mops`-only TOML config file.

### MOPS_CONFIG

Take that file, name it whatever you want, and set the environment variable `MOPS_CONFIG` to point to its
fully-qualified path.

### .mops.toml

Or, name that file `.mops.toml` and place that in one of the following locations:

1. The current working directory for the Python process that imports `mops`.
1. Your home directory.

## combined config

Or, define and load the config however you want (e.g. YAML, JSON, XML) within your project, and once you
have a nested Python dictionary that corresponds to the multilevel config table that `mops` expects, call
`thds.mops.config:set_global_config` before beginning to use `mops`.

## dynamic stack-local config

`mops` will also allow your Python application to dynamically override particular config values on a
per-thread/async coroutine level. It provides a context manager for configuration that will allow you to
set the config for all code called 'below' your `with` statement, like so:

[source,python]
----
with mops.config.set_config("mops", "k8s", "namespace")(your_value):
    call_some_func()
	do_more_stuff()
	# everything in here will see your config value,
	# while anything else running in the same process
	# will see whatever the previously-configured value is.
	...
use_original_config()  # and this will not see the configured value from above
