# pure.magic

Magic is a new API that we're trialling for `mops`. This ties together a lot of
functionality that has already been available in `mops.pure`, but the hope is to provide
an interface that makes it a lot simpler for users to move between development workflows
and production ones, including running your functions locally with mops in the loop, and
running your functions locally with mops xref:#off[completely out of the loop]. Each of
these approaches is the right choice for specific situations, and setting things up for
this to work should be as easy as we can make it.

NOTE: The `pure.magic` group of APIs is designed to be used at the module level, during
import, as it modifies the global state of your `mops` configuration. For stack-local
modifications, a future API is envisioned.

== `@pure.magic` - the easy button

When you're getting started, you can apply `@pure.magic()` to your function directly as a decorator,
without any other config. By default, your function will now:

- run in the same thread where it was called, just like a normal Python function.
- be memoized underneath `~/.mops` on your local machine.

Using this decorator sets you up to be able to configure 3 core pieces of `mops` based on
module trees, in whatever combinations suit your application, and even to modify that
config based on a xref:config-file[configuration file loaded inside your CLI]. Those core
pieces are:

1. the xref:runtime-shim[runtime shim] (which defaults to `'samethread'`)
2. the xref:blob-root[blob root] (which defaults to `+file://~/.mops+`)
3. the xref:pipeline-id[pipeline id] (which defaults to `'magic'`)

[[runtime-shim]]
== `pure.magic.shim` - Set the runtime shim (f.k.a. Shell)

If you want your function to run with a different link:./shims.adoc[runtime shim], use
`+pure.magic.shim(...)+` as function at the module level, or pass a shim as the first
argument to `@pure.magic(your_shim)`.

Valid arguments in addition to actual Shim objects are ``ShimBuilder`` callables, the
special-cased string names `'subprocess'` and `'samethread'`, and `'off'`, which
disable `mops` entirely.

Shims can be applied to a single function, all functions in a leaf module, or all in a module tree.

.`foo/bar/baz.py`
[source, python]
----
from .k8s_conf import k8s_shim

@pure.magic()
def your_func(...):
    ...

# these only apply to your_func
pure.magic.shim('subprocess', your_func)
# or
pure.magic.shim(k8s_shim(cpus=4), your_func)
----

.`foo/bar/baz.py`
[source, python]
----
pure.magic.shim('subprocess')
# this applies to everything in this module...

@pure.magic()
def func1(...):
    ...

@pure.magic()
def func2(...):
    ...

# ...except func3, which has a more specific configuration applied directly to it.
@pure.magic('samethread')
def func3(...):
    ...

pure.magic.shim('samethread', func3)
# this is an alternate approach that accomplishes _exactly_
# the same thing as the decorator version immediately above.
----

.`+foo/bar/__init__.py+`
[source,python]
----
pure.magic.shim(k8s_shim(cpus=8))
# applies to everything under foo.bar. However,
# it would _not_ override anything in foo.bar.baz above, which has a more specific config.
----

=== mask=True

Finally, if you _do_ need to _override_ an entire branch of the module tree, you can use
`mask=True` - but do this carefully! It is intended that you would use `mask` for
temporary, development workflows, whereas for the 'standard' or 'production' setup, you
would generally prefer having the configuration as close as possible to the site of use,
and not impose overrides with mask.

.`+foo/bar/__init__.py+`
[source,python]
----
pure.magic.shim('off', mask=True)
----

[[off]]
=== Turning `mops` off for a module tree or a function

`shim('off')` turns off `mops` - `magic` will not run your function through mops at all.

`+pure.magic.off(...)+` is an alias for `shim('off', ...)`

[[blob-root]]
== `pure.magic.blob_root` - Set the blob root

If you want to customize that blob store root to be something else, like an ADLS container, you
can use `blob_root`, again either as a parameter to the decorator, or as a module-level
call.

.`foo/bar/baz.py`
[source,python]
----
@pure.magic(blob_root='adls://bell/rings')
def your_func(...):
    ...

# is equivalent to:
pure.magic.blob_root('adls://bell/rings', your_func)
----

[[pipeline-id]]
== `pure.magic.pipeline_id` - Set the link:pipeline-ids.adoc[pipeline id]

This is like the blob root or shims above. It can be set for a given function, or for a
leaf module or module tree.

.`foo/bar/baz.py`
[source, python]
----
pure.magic.pipeline_id('doors/time')
# this applies to everything in this module...

@pure.magic()
def func1(...):
    ...

# ...except func2, which has a more specific configuration applied directly to it.
@pure.magic(pipeline_id='thousand/years')
def func2(...):
    ...
----

`mask=True` is supported for `blob_root` and `pipeline_id` as well.

== Recommendations

=== blob root - near the root of your project

It's unlikely you'll want different ``blob_root``s for different functions within your
application. Just set that once, near the root of your application module tree in an
`+__init__.py+` somewhere, and leave it.

=== shims - on the functions themselves

For advanced runtime shims, it's quite likely that different functions will have different
resource requirements, and if you're running remotely (e.g. on Kubernetes), it's the shim
that provides the specification to the remote environment.

A fairly readable way to match resource requirements directly with functions is to have a
function that creates shims based on resource arguments, e.g. the toy `k8s_shim(cpus=8)`
in the example earlier.  This would mean passing the shim directly to the decorator, as
`@pure.magic(k8s_shim(cpus=8))` - this makes it clear to readers how much computation you
expect your function to do.

Specifying this on a per-function basis is likely your best option for a lot of scenarios,
and it doesn't lock you out from later choosing to run one or more of these with a
different shim, or entirely outside of mops - remember, you can always apply
`pure.magic.shim('off', your_func)` later on to drop `mops` entirely, or to set a different
shim as desired.

=== pipeline id - logical groupings of your code

Pipeline is a grouping mechanism, so use it like one. Put `pure.magic.pipeline_id` at
points in the module tree that make sense as high-level group names within your
application. Use pipeline ids with an appropriate but not excessive amount of
hierarchy. Find something that works well for your team and stick to it.

=== module config - at the top of the module

If you're setting a module-wide value, set that near the top of your module. It's nice to
be able to see that sort of 'broad config' near the top with other types of globals that
are consumed in the rest of the module.

== Putting it all together

pure.magic.blob_store('adls://lazing/sunday')
----

.`+foo/bar/__init__.py+`

----
from thds.mops import pure

pure.magic.pipeline_id('app/quux')
----

.`+foo/bar/forty_nine.py+`
[source,python]
----
from thds.mops import pure

@pure.magic('subprocess')
def explore(...):
    ...
----

.`+foo/quux/car.py+`

@pure.magic(
    k8s.shim(
        'docker.io/royal-image:latest',
        node_narrowing=dict(cpus=8)
    ),
    pipeline_id='scaramouche',
    blob_root='adls://thunderbolt/lightning',
)
def fandango(...):
    ...

[[config-file]]
== Config external to code

Several things that `mops.pure.magic` does can also be configured outside the code, though
none of them will work without first applying the `@pure.magic` decorator to your
function.

For many use cases, the Python APIs will be the best bet, but for more complex scenarios,
or for developer convenience in trying something different without modifying the code, you
can create a `.mops.toml` file at an appropriate place in your codebase. Call
`pure.magic.load_config_file()` in your `+__main__+` to look 'up' from the current working
directory of the process, and load config from the link:../src/thds/mops/config.py[first
`.mops.toml` file that it finds].

NOTE: Configuration loaded at the time of calling `pure.magic.load_config_file()` will
override any configuration expressed statically through use of `pure.magic....` calls at
the roots of your modules - unless those modules are imported after loading
the config file. It is up to you to deal with the order of operations when loading config files.

A `.mops.toml` can express anything that the static calls to `pure.magic....` express, using
the syntax shown below:

.`+.mops.toml+`
[source,toml]
----
[foo]
mops.pure.magic.blob_root = "adls://secret/harmonies"

[foo.bar]
mops.pure.magic.blob_root = "adls://secret/bar"
__mask.mops.pure.magic.shim = 'off'

[foo.bar.baz.func1]
mops.pure.magic.shim = 'sameprocess'
----

The above would be exactly equivalent to the following `pure.magic` usage:

.`+foo/__init__.py+`
[source,python]
----
pure.magic.blob_root('adls://secret/harmonies')
----

.`+foo/bar/__init__.py+`
[source,python]
----
pure.magic.blob_root('adls://secret/bar')
pure.magic.shim('off', mask=True)
----

.`foo/bar/baz.py`
[source,python]
----

@pure.magic()
def func1(...):
    ...

pure.magic.shim('sameprocess')
----

NOTE: because of the `foo.bar` shim _mask_ at `foo.bar`, the `sameprocess` shim for
`func1` will not be used - everything under `foo.bar` would be a non-mops passthrough
function call.
