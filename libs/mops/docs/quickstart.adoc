# Quickstart

NOTE: Normally, `mops` would be used with a cloud-based blob store and some kind of
cloud-based remote link:./shims.adoc[runtime shim], e.g. Kubernetes or AWS
Lambda.footnote:[Lambda is not yet a runtime shim, but it could be!] This is a trivial
example to allow you to see `mops` in action with no dependencies other than the library
itself.

* `pip install thds.mops` (a virtual environment is recommended)

.`docs/fibonacci.py`
[source,python]
----
import sys
from thds.mops import pure

@pure.magic()  # memoizes inside ~/.mops/ by default
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(f"fibonacci({n}) == {fibonacci(n)}")
----

* `python docs/fibonacci.py 30`

If you run the above code, you'll see a lot of logs - `mops` logs at `INFO` level by default. What you should notice is that the code starts out with a lot of logs with green backgrounds that say `+Invoking file://~/.mops/...+`, as `mops` runs `fibonacci` with the relevant arguments for the first time... but quickly there start to be blue background logs saying `+memoized value for file://~/.mops/... already exists and is being returned without invocation!+`. `mops` is running `fibonacci` every time it finds new arguments for the function - but when it finds previously-completed calls with the same arguments, it reuses the memoized result.

Eventually the program prints `fibonacci(30) == 832040`, and it's done!

The second time you run this program... it will emit only a single 'blue' log, and immediately print `fibonacci(30) == 832040`. The very first call was one that it had seen before, and it reused the result directly.

Try a third time, with `python docs/fibonacci.py 31`, and you'll get what you expected - only a single new function invocation, and everything else is reused from the previous runs.

## How does this work?

Look inside the `~/.mops/mops2-mpf` directory. You'll see the folder `magic`. This corresponds to the `pipeline-id` set by default with the `pure.magic` decorator. If you link:memoization.adoc#pipeline-id[change] this `pipeline-id`, your previous runs won't be reused, and you'll see a new folder created with the changed pipeline id mask. You can change it in link:pipeline-ids.adoc[several ways] depending on your needs.

Look inside `~/.mops/mops2-mpf/magic`. You'll see the folder `+__main__--fibonacci+`. This is the `+{module}--{function.__name__}+` for your function. This keeps each and every function in your system distinct from every other, no matter what.

Look inside `+~/.mops/mops2-mpf/magic/__main__--fibonacci+`. You'll see 30 directories, each with an odd three-word name with more base64-encoded gibberish after it. This is the SHA256 hash of the arguments to your function - in this case, only `n`. Inside each of these is an `invocation`, a `result`, a `lock` directory, and a `result-metadata-...` file. The only ones you care about are `invocation` and `result`.

Run `+mops-inspect file://~/.mops/mops2-mpf/magic/__main__--fibonacci/GhostJamLayer._ClxDsKdEb8h6isreN4jt8R0cVmsIIemKaADUOs+`. You should see output that looks something like:

)
----

* Your function's name is there, along with its args and kwargs (in this case, it was the call to `fibonacci(8)`).
* Its result is there (21).
* There's a bunch of `ResultMetadata` - you can ignore this for now, but you might find it handy later.
* No exception was raised by the function. If something bad _had_ happened, you'd see the `Exception` here.

## Take a victory lap!

You've successfully installed and used `mops`. Although it's a toy example, everything you need for local-only memoization is already working.

If you want to do very expensive computations inside automagically-launched subprocesses,
rather than in the same thread as `@pure.magic()` does by default, you could call it as
`@pure.magic('subprocess')`.footnote:[Technically, you'll also need to move your function
into a separate module from your `+__main__+`, as Python makes it difficult to track down
the actual module your code is in if it's being run as main.] If you prefer to provide a
different link:./shims.adoc[shim], like a Kubernetes runner, see the further
link:magic.adoc[docs on `pure.magic`].  Believe it or not... if you have read+write access
to an ADLS Storage Account and Container, you can replace the default `"file://~/.mops"`
blob root like so: `@pure.magic(blob_root="adls://yoursa/container/")`, and `mops` will
automatically share your results across any other users of the same SA+Container.

Sprinkle in some Docker images and a Kubernetes cluster (using the built-in `mops.k8s.shim`), and you'll have remotely-running Python code just by calling your own functions.
