## Limitations

### ADLS-first

Azure Data Lake Storage is the only cloud blob store for which we provide an implementation - and if your remote runner can't access the same blob store as the local, then `mops` cannot transfer the execution there (and the result back). The library itself
allows other blob store implementations (following the interface defined in link:../src/thds/mops/pure/core/types.py[core/types] to be registered upon installation as an `importlib.metadata` entrypoint - `thds.mops.pure.blob_stores`. See link:../src/thds/mops/pure/core/uris.py[core/uris] for the required plugin interface.

NOTE: Our ADLS blob store implementation has evolved currently with `mops` - it uses a machine-global read-only cache with MD5 hash invalidation, as well as other optimizations. A naive implementation of a different blob store will work as long as it is threadsafe, but you may encounter inefficiencies (e.g. re-downloads), as `mops` leaves this sort of optimization as an exercise for the upstream implementation.

### Network bottlenecks

This library (and our ADLS blob store implementation) has improved over time, but over years of use we have observed that while you can orchestrate
 workloads of up to ~1000 concurrently-running functions against ADLS just fine, larger workloads (tens of thousands of `use_runner`
calls simultaneously) may be difficult to manage over a network connection between your laptop and the
Azure datacenters, causing spurious authentication, connection timeout, and other network errors. If you
start running into these issues, we recommend the approach of launching the orchestrator process on the 'inside' of an Azure
datacenter - on a link:./kubernetes.adoc#orchestrator-pods[pod inside] the Kubernetes cluster.

### No specific semantics for DAGs

This is both a limitation and a feature. `mops` encourages you to provide your own Python-based
link:./orchestrator.adoc#concurrency[control flow between concurrent tasks], meaning that you can write code
like code, rather than code like config.

However, if you're in a situation where you absolutely can't live without some kind of DAG runner, `mops`
won't provide that for you. Happily, it _will_ stay out of your way and allow you to wrap any
sufficiently capable DAG runner around it, while allowing you to reap the benefits of
link:./memoization.adoc[memoization] and efficient transfer of control to the remote runtime.
