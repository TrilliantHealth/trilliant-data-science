## 0.12.0

- in `tabularasa push`, switched `no_fail_if_absent` from a positional arg parsed to boolean to a flag
  (`--no-fail-if-absent`)
- imbued `--no-fail-if-absent` with semantics in the `taburasa sync-blob-store --down`/`tabularasa pull`
  case (previously it only appled to the `--up`/`push` case). Now, if you attempt to sync a blob down
  which has no corresponding blob in the blob store, there is no error.
- in `tabularasa datagen`, the blob store sync down to local files is run with the new
  `no_fail_if_absent` semantics. Any blobs which fail to sync, that are required in the build DAG, will
  just be regenerated as part of the build, due to absence or hash mismatches.

### 0.11.3

flake8 and black

### 0.11.2

- upper bound on `pandera` version due to changes with `pandas` dependencies in that release

### 0.11.1

- internally uses `thds.core.git.get_repo_root()`

### 0.11.0

- `tabularasa pull` and `tabularasa sync-blob-store` now both accept optional `--tables` to allow for
  syncing only a subset of tables, and use multithreading for parallel I/O operations.

### 0.10.1

- Fix bug in use of `numpy.dtypes`, which does not exist in numpy\<1.25.

## 0.10.0

- `requires-python>=3.10`.
- Take upper-bounds off of `pandas`, `pandera`, and `numpy`.
  - Increases `pandas` lower-bound to `>=1.5`.
  - Increases `pandera` lower-bound to `>=0.20`.
- Renames `loaders.util.unique` to `loaders.util.unique_across_columns` and registers this as a custom
  `pandas` check in `pandera`.
- No longer coerces numeric numpy index dtypes to 64-bit when using `pandas>=2.0`.
- Enforces the use of nanosecond datetime precision across pyarrow and (numpy-based) pandas datetime
  types for consistent behavior.
  - `pandas<2.0` only supported nanosecond precision, so sticking with that for for simplicity across
    `pandas` versions.
- Adds a `compat` module with some code that gets rendered (to be called) on `numpy` numeric types set as
  indices in `pandas.DataFrame`s.

### 0.9.4

- Added tests for `FileSourceMixin.needs_update`.
- Added a new valid value, `Biannual`, for a table's `update_frequency`.

### 0.9.3

- Removed some annoying module-level CLI-related warnings from the main module, and improved the error
  message when required CLI dependencies are not installed.

### 0.9.2

- `data-diff` now errors when passed table names which are not in the schema.
- `data-diff` now shows metadata changes for diff-able tables.

### 0.9.1

- Migrating from `poetry` -> `uv` for project management + some typing fixes.

## 0.9.0

- Added a new `--value-detail` flag and `--value-detail-min-count` option to the `data-diff` command to
  allow for inspecting counts of specific row-level updates for each column that was modified in a table.

## 0.8.0

- Made the `datagen` command perform a data sync by default to avoid errors arising from stale data, with
  a new optional `--no-sync` flag to disable this behavior.
- Added a new `--debug` flag to the `data-diff` command to drop into a debugger whenever a positive table
  diff is found.

### 0.7.3

- Fixed a bug in the use of `ruamel.yaml` in the CLI which caused errors when multithreading `tabularasa`
  schema loads/saves in parallel.

### 0.7.2

- Fixed the use of buggy pandas index intersection method

### 0.7.1

- `tabularasa data-diff` updates:
  - Optimization: skips computing diffs for tables whose historical and current md5 hashes are equal
  - Table diffs print in alphabetical order by table name
  - `tabulate`'s `floatfmt` arg is used explicitly and set to `.6g` to avoid excessive significant digits

## 0.7.0

- Fixed broken rendering of URLs in sphinx documentation as produced by `tabularasa docgen`
- Added github urls for those source data files in a schema that are in version control

## 0.6.0

- Added new `schema-diff` command to compare the current schema against a previous version of the schema
  and output the differences in a human-readable markdown format.

## 0.5.0

- `tabularasa datagen` now ensures _all_ tables in the schema are recomputed when run without args

## 0.4.0

- Changed metaschema and semantics for `inherit_schema` to facilitate simpler reasoning about the schema
  of tables using inheritance:
  - `exclude_columns` is now forbidden
  - `columns` is added and when specified lists a set of column names to explicitly inherit from the
    parent tables

### 0.3.7

- Adding `sqlite_from_parquet` for conversion from parquet to a DB defined by a tabularasa schema

### 0.3.6

- Fixes for mypy 1.11

### 0.3.5

- Set some reasonable defaults in schema `build_options`, specifically:
  - `type_constraint_comments` is now `True` by default
  - `validate_transient_tables` is now `True` by default
  - `require_typing_extensions` is now `False` by default since python 3.7 is at end-of-life

### 0.3.4

- Lazily load some sqlite databases from the somewhat more flexible `core.Source`, rather than the
  ADLS-specific `adls.AdlsHashedResource`.

### 0.3.3

- Added logic in Schema to inform when a data source needs to be checked for updates.

### 0.3.2

- Added a `read_only` flag to the `sqlite_connection` routine, `False` by default but set to `True` in
  `AttrsSQLiteDatabase`. This prevents errors when multiple threads share a connection in read-only
  workflows.

### 0.3.1

- More verbose logging of sqlite db path when populating db.

## 0.3.0

- Added a helper function `check_categorical_dtype` to use consistently on all reads and writes when
  dealing with `pandas.CategoricalDtype`s, to raise loud errors consistently everywhere when unexpected
  values are present rather than allow pandas' usual behavior of nulling those values out on cast.

### 0.2.1

- Added helper function that adds line breaks to long strings. The function is used when formatting
  Sphinx tables.

## 0.2

- Migrating to Python ^3.9 (numpy/pandas stack no longer supports 3.8).

## 0.1

- Initial release in the monorepo.
