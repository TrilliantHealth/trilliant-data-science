"""Sometimes, you just want to cache hashes. Specifically, hashes of files.

We cache these hashes as files themselves, and the default location is under the user's
home directory.

The name of the file is an implementation detail that includes the hash of the file path,
the directory it lives in is the hashlib name of the hash algorithm, and the contents of
the file are the raw bytes of the hash. However, none of these details is guaranteed to
remain stable over time, and the only stable interface is the `hash_file` and `filehash`
functions themselves.
