# HELLO!
#
# If you don't mind, please specify fairly strong bounds
# for _development_ dependencies in the Pipfile for a library.
# The reasoning is that we never want our stuff to break because
# of a backward-incompatible change to something like mypy or pytest.

# PROJECT-SPECIFIC

#################
# By contrast, runtime dependencies (defined in pyproject.toml) should
# be as loose as semantically correct, because this is a library and
# we want to give applications maximum latitude to choose their own
# versions of libraries.
