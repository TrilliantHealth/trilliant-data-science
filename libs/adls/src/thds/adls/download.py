# Async is weird.
#
# You cannot easily call an async function from within a standard/non-async function.
# And while you _can_ call a synchronous function from within an async one,
# it's highly discouraged if that function is doing network I/O,
# because your sync network IO will block the entire async green thread,
# grinding all 'async' work to a halt. It's very unneighborly.
#
# Unfortunately, this means that it's quite difficult to share the implementation
# of complex logic between async and non-async users. You can't use callbacks to abstract
# I/O, because those would themselves need to be either async or not.
#
# What you can do is a sort of 'functional core, imperative shell' approach,
# where the I/O parts are performed in a top level imperative shell, and the functional
# (logic) parts are performed in the shared core. As with many such things,
# the trick then is how to structure the functional core such that it 'makes sense' to a reader.
#
# One traditional means of doing this is breaking the functional core up into
# several functions to be called before and after the network calls.
# However, that does tend to impair readability, as those core functions
# each only do part of the work, and sometimes the 'part' doesn't make as much
# sense on its own as you might like.
#
# This is (to me) an entirely novel approach, and as such is an experiment.
# By writing a coroutine (the logic directly below) as the functional core,
# we can make the main 'logic' of the system readable in one go.
# What is required is a willingness to read the `yield` statements as
# essentially the 'inverse' of async/await - yield means "send this value to
# my controller and wait for their response'. Once the response is sent, we can
# resume where we left off, and the logic flows reasonably nicely.
#
# One _additional_ advantage of this approach is that certain bits of IO
# can actually be re-requested at any time, and the coroutine's controller
# can in a sense 'cache' those responses. So instead of the core logic
# having to keep track of whether it has performed the IO, it can request the result
# again and rely on the controller to re-send the previously fetched result.

    When we download from ADLS we want to know for sure that we have
    the bytes we expected.  Sometimes we have a hash upfront that we
    want to verify.  Other times, we simply want to rely on the hash
    ADLS has. If we have both, we should check anything we have the
    opportunity to check.

    Because we're verifying everything, we can optionally offer two
    sorts of verified caching.

    1. With no local cache, we can at least verify whether the file is
    present at the local path and contains the expected bytes.  If it
    does, there's no need to re-download.

    2. With a cache provided, we can also check that cache, and if the
    file is present in the local cache, we can either hard/soft link or copy
    it into the expected location, depending on the Cache configuration.

    If the file is not present in either location, we finally download
    the file from ADLS and then verify that the local hash matches
    both what we expected and what ADLS told us it would be, if any.

    The downloaded file will always placed into the cache if a cache
    is provided.  The local path, if different from the cache path,
    will either be linked or copied to, as selected by
    `cache.link`. `link=True` will save storage space but is not what
    you want if you intend to modify the file.

    Files placed in the cache will be marked as read-only to prevent
    _some_ types of accidents. This will not prevent you from
    accidentally or maliciously moving files on top of existing cached
    files, but it will prevent you from opening those files for
    writing in a standard fashion.

    Raises StopIteration when complete. StopIteration.value.hit will
    be the Path to the cached file if there was a cache hit, and None
    if a download was required. `.value` will also contain the Hash of
    the downloaded file, which may be used as desired.
